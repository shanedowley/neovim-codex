Explain the following snippet step-by-step (C and C++ where relevant).

Rules:
- First, echo the snippet exactly as you received it in a fenced block labeled: ```received ... ```.
- If the snippet appears incomplete/truncated, say so explicitly before analysis.
- Be strictly accurate about the C/C++ standard rules. If unsure, say so.
- Clearly separate: (A) well-defined behavior, (B) unspecified/indeterminate order, (C) implementation-defined behavior, (D) undefined behavior (UB).
- When discussing arithmetic, be precise about: integer promotions, usual arithmetic conversions, and signed/unsigned mixing.
- Do NOT claim that 'float promotes to double' in ordinary expressions in C. (That's only guaranteed for default argument promotions, e.g., varargs.)
- Do NOT say 'snippet is incomplete/truncated'. Treat it as a standalone snippet and state assumptions explicitly (e.g., assume a and b are int unless shown otherwise).
- Separate compile-time ill-formed/constraint violations from runtime UB. Don't label missing includes as runtime UB; say 'diagnostic required' (C) / 'ill-formed' (C++).
- For C++, be precise: <cstdio> + std::printf (don't imply printf is always in the global namespace).
- Only raise format-string UB if you can name the exact mismatch after default argument promotions.
- For sequencing UB, use the canonical language: 'unsequenced modification and value computation/read of the same scalar' (C++) / 'between sequence points, a side effect and an unsequenced read' (C). Don't paraphrase
- For pointer arithmetic, state the valid range (same array object or one-past) and what is UB.
- Keep it concise: maximum 12 bullets. No filler, focused on what applies to THIS snippet.
- Do NOT rewrite the code unless I ask.

Explain the following {{filetype}} snippet step-by-step.

Rules:
- First, echo the snippet exactly as you received it in a fenced block labeled: ```received ... ```.
- Be strictly accurate about the language semantics and runtime behavior. If unsure, say so explicitly.
- Focus on what THIS snippet does and why (control flow, data flow, key language features used).
- Call out likely errors, edge cases, and surprising behavior, but don’t invent context not present.
- Keep it concise: maximum 12 bullets.
- Do NOT rewrite the code unless I ask.

You are rewriting ONLY the selected text provided below.

Return ONLY the replacement text BETWEEN these exact markers, and NOTHING else:
<<<BEGIN>>>
(replacement lines)

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Output must contain BOTH markers, always.
- No explanation, no questions, no advice.
- No markdown fences/backticks in your output.
- Preserve indentation and line breaks.
- Output must be valid code for the same language as the input.

If you cannot comply, your entire output MUST be exactly:
<<<BEGIN>>>
ERROR
<<<END>>>
